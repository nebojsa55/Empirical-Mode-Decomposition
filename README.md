<img src="https://github.com/nebojsa55/Empirical-Mode-Decomposition/blob/master/doc/emd_gif.gif" width="600" height="400"/>

An example and introduction to EMD (Empirical mode decomposition) algorithm. EMD is the basis for [HHT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert%E2%80%93Huang_transform) and is very suitable for work with non-stationary signals.

This script will show the implementation of classical EMD algorithm. For other kinds of EMD, such as ensemble EMD, please refer to:
